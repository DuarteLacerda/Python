# Python 🐍
Personal project – Just for fun and learning

**Python Playground** is a personal repository where I collect programming exercises and small games developed in Python. The main goal is to practise logic, reinforce programming concepts, and explore the possibilities that Python offers.  

This project is not linked to any course or academic work — it was created solely on my initiative as a space for experimentation and continuous learning.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries  
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (for some games)  

## 🎮 Content  
- Exercises in logic, data structures, and algorithms  
- Small interactive games (such as Snake, Pong, among others)  
- Useful scripts and simple projects in Python  

## 🚀 How to run the project  
1. Clone the repository:
```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/DuarteLacerda/Python.git  
   cd Python
   ```
2. Make sure you have Python installed.  
3. For games that use `pygame`, install the library:  
   ```bash  
   pip install pygame  
   ```  
4. Run any file with:  
```bash  
   python filename.py  
   ```
